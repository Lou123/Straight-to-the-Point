        <h2>About the Owner</h2>
        <p>
          Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the
          United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and started Straight to the Point in part because
          he was not satisfied with the archery education options for them in Tacoma.

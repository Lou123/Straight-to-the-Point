          “We’re very excited to see the tremendous growth of our sport. People are connecting with archery more than ever before, and we see that reflected in our membership numbers and event participation,” Denise Parker, chief executive of USA Archery, told NerdWallet. Movies like “The Hunger Games” and “The Avengers” have propelled the surge in interest, Parker says. “In the past 12 months especially, we’ve seen huge increases in female and youth participation, and we’re excited to see that trend continue.”
